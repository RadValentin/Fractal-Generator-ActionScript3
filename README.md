#Fractal Generator ActionScript 3
_A simple fractal generator I made using AS3 (college project)_
<br/>

**Live version [here](http://radvalentin.github.io/Fractal-Generator-ActionScript3/)**

###Instructions

1. Click anywhere on the farctal image to zoom in
2. Use the right bar to set different drawing parameters and press **Draw** to render the fractal
3. Use the 3 bottom buttons to switch between fractal types
4. Ignore the **Zoom** button

###Notes

- Code is uncommented, comments comming soon! 
- Performance won't be lightning fast due to the way in which fractals are generated. If you know of any way to speed up the calculations or reduce the number of cycles without loosing image details, please let me know.
